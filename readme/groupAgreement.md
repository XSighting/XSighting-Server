# X-Sightings Group Agreement
## Communication plan
- Everyone gets to say something on a subject.
- Before stand-up we meet and discuss what issues/bugs we have. Then in stand-up we can discuss them at a detailed  level.
- We’ll create a safe space by respecting each other’s opinions and views.
- Discuss how we are feeling in terms of work load and the weight of the project and progress.

## Conflict plan
- When there is a conflict, the two people will discuss it, if no resolution comes from that, then bring it to the whole team where we decide as a group as how to compromise and move forward. If no decision can be made by the team, then bring in a 3rd party--Michelle.
- Take time to consider and disconnect from the tension and take a walk or something.
- Always assume others have good intentions.

## Git process
- `Master` Branch is the deployed branch on Heroku, then `development` branch runs parallel to `master`. Everyone branches from the `development` and works on feature branches.
- **Merges:** request another team member to merge your feature branch to the `development` branch. Two team member approvals are required for merges to the `master` branch.


## Work plan
- We’re planning to use Github Kanban to assign tasks.
- Each morning we will decide who gets to work on each task (on volunteer basis).
- The goal is to get everyone to be involved in each part of it.
- **Other:**
  - Work Schedule:
      - Everyone starts at 9am
      - 1 hr lunch break
      - Check-in at 5pm, hard stop at 6pm
      - Take breaks as needed
  - Ask for help after 15 minutes. **Be receptive for help.**
